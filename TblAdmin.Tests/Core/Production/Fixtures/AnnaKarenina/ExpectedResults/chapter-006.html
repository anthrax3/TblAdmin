<p>Part 2: Chapter 3.</p>
<p>When she went into Kitty’s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety. Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low chair near the door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug. Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered expression of her face did not change.</p>
<p>&quot;I’m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won’t be able to come to see me,&quot; said Dolly, sitting down beside her. &quot;I want to talk to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about?&quot; Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.</p>
<p>&quot;What should it be, but your trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, Kitty. Do you suppose I could help knowing? I know all about it. And believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... We’ve all been through it.&quot;</p>
<p>Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.</p>
