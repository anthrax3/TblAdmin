<p>Chapter Four.</p>
<p>“Tell me again why you’re doing this?” Hannah asks.</p>
<p>I upend my board and grab it by the trucks. We climb the front stairs of my house. “’Cause. It’ll be fun.” I jiggle my key in the old brass lock. The door swings open, and I step into the entryway.</p>
<p>Hannah doesn’t follow. She stays on the doorstep, arms folded. “Owen.”</p>
<p>Only Hannah has that way of saying my name. “Flash mobs are fun. Parasailing is fun. But writing a relationship blog? This doesn’t sound like you. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Crap. She’s not buying it. She’ll laugh if I tell her the real reason behind the Oracle. Especially after what she witnessed today.</p>
<p>I shrug. “I want to see how many people I can get to read it.” I motion for her to come in. She stands in the doorway, stubbornly.</p>
<p>I sigh and push her out of the way so I can close the door. Hannah’s not someone most people can push out of the way. But I can. We’ve been friends since our mothers met at baby music class thirteen years ago. I’ve seen Hannah barf all down her best dress. She’s seen me pee my pants. Twice.</p>
<p>Hannah furrows her dark brows. “You want to see how many people read it?”</p>
<p>she repeats. “Really? Owen, when was the last time you wrote more than ten words in a row? What’s with the sudden urge to host an entire”—she looks for the right word—“gossip blog for our school?”</p>
<p>I put my arm around her shoulders. “I don’t plan to do it all alone,” I say. “You’re going to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to help you?” She looks at me like I’m speaking Finnish. “I haven’t agreed to anything.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but you’re brilliant, Hannah,” I say, laying it on thick. “Your ideas are way better than mine. Your research skills are tops. Plus, you’re funny.”</p>
<p>Never mind that I’m too lazy to make the blog happen by myself. I need her help to get it up and running.</p>
<p>I head for the kitchen. I don’t want to appear desperate. I’ll lose ground if she thinks it matters too much.</p>
<p>She follows me into the kitchen, her arms still crossed. I take two packages of cookies out of the cupboard and hand one to her. She shakes her head and takes an apple from the fruit bowl instead.</p>
<p>“Are you going to tell me what this is really all about?” she says, polishing her apple on her jeans.</p>
<p>I sigh. Hannah can’t be dodged. She knows me way too well. I go straight to the heart of it. “Kamryn’s in love with my brother.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Well, Kyle’s a jerk. You know that.”</p>
<p>“I do know that,” says Hannah. “But I don’t see what a blog has to do with it.” She takes a bite of apple.</p>
<p>“I want to use it to steer her away from him.”</p>
<p>“How’s that going to work?” she asks.</p>
<p>I shrug. “Post misleading love advice and get Kamryn to read it.”</p>
<p>Hannah regards me suspiciously. “What’s it to you who Kamryn likes?”</p>
<p>Ah. This is where it gets tricky. I don’t want to tell my best friend that I’m crushing hard on the most popular girl in our grade. I’m afraid she’ll tell me I don’t stand a chance with Kamryn. Or worse, she’ll laugh. Hannah’s not one to keep her opinions to herself.</p>
<p>I shrug again. “It’s more about not letting Kyle have the satisfaction of yet another girl wasting her love on him.”</p>
<p>Hannah peels the sticker off the apple and flattens it on the counter. “You should let Kyle have her,” she says. “They’d be perfect for each other.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Hannah shrugs.</p>
<p>“What?” I ask again.</p>
<p>But she doesn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>I say, “I think my idea could work. Plus it would be fun to get the school hooked on a relationship blog.”</p>
<p>“But it’s bogus!” Hannah protests.</p>
<p>I shake my head. “Only the Kamryn- Kyle posts,” I say. “The rest of it can be legit. Real advice.”</p>
<p>Hannah sighs. “What if you put all that energy into skating instead, Owen? Or helping me organize the Free the Children Gala?”</p>
<p>“Come on,” I say. “How much fun would it be to mess with a thousand people’s heads like this?”</p>
<p>Her eyes get a faraway look.</p>
<p>Good. She’s thinking about it.</p>
<p>When she looks back at me, I raise an eyebrow. I move in for the kill. Playing on her do-gooder side. “Think of all the lives you’d be touching,” I say. “You could really help people…find love and all that.”</p>
<p>She tilts her head. “It would be kind of fun to see the response it gets.”</p>
<p>“So you’re in?”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying I’ll write anything.”</p>
<p>“So you’re in?” I repeat, giving her leg a little nudge with my foot.</p>
<p>“You could get in big trouble if this ever gets out, Owen.”</p>
<p>“It won’t. I’ll make sure of it.”</p>
<p>Hannah looks up at the ceiling and releases a long, slow breath. When she looks back at me, there’s a gleam in her eye.</p>
<p>“I’m in.”</p>
