Chapter One 

I can’t help it. She’s beautiful. I have 
to stare. 

My love is like to ice and I to fire. 

The words from that Renaissance 
guy’s poem spool around in my head 
in a repeating loop. Mr. Schmidt would 
be proud that I remembered something 
from his class last year. 

1 


Poems don’t usually make a lot of 
sense to me. But this one did. It was 
so true. The harder this poor guy loved 
the girl, the colder she got. He can’t 
figure out why he can’t melt her one little 
bit when he burns for her. 

I totally get that. Looking at her stony 
perfection, I don’t think I could melt 
Kamryn Holt’s heart in a million years. 

But that doesn’t mean I can’t try. 

Maybe I’ll ask her to go to the dance 
with me. 

Huh. Right. 

Maybe when pigs fly. 

When the bell rings, my daydream 
ends and another screamingly dull social 
studies class is over. People fling their 
books into their bags and charge out 
the door. 

It’s lunch, and finally it’s nice enough 
to sit outside. 

By the time I make it through the 
crowded doorway, Kamryn is sitting 

2 


at her usual place on the concrete wall. 
She is surrounded by other girls. 

Even if I wanted to ask her to the 
dance, there’s no way I could do it in 
front of that crowd. How do guys ever 
get anywhere with girls when all girls do 
is huddle together like a bunch of ducks? 

The wall is a popular spot for the eights 
and nines. The sevens sit at the picnic tables. 
The sixes run around on the playground, 
screaming and pushing each other like 
demented toddlers. The senior students 
usually go to McDonald’s or Starbucks 
for lunch. 

I stroll toward the wall. I take a seat 
a few feet down from the girl gaggle. 
I pull my iPod from my backpack. Mason 
spots me and heads across the grass in 
my direction. 

I unwind my headphones and take a 
package of cookies from my lunch. 

Scratch that. The cookies are my 
lunch. I’ve been raised on Oreos and 

3 


Chips Ahoy ever since my mom declared 
she was done making lunches. That was 
two years ago. 

Mason drops his pack and plops 
down. “I hate Prost’s class,” he says. 
“He’s so picky.” 

“Got your essay back?” I ask, glancing 
at him. Kamryn is exactly in my line of 
sight. I should thank Mason for sitting in 
the perfect spot. 

Mason nods. “He killed it,” he says. 
“I mean, who cares if I spell dumb without 
the b? It’s silent. Who remembers to 
add silent letters anyway?” 

I shrug. “People who passed grade 
two?” I pop an Oreo into my mouth. 

“Weren’t you the one who failed 
grade two?” he retorts. 

“I taught it, bro.” 

Mason laughs. “Hey, you coming over 
tonight? I finally got Naruto Shippuden 
for my Xbox. You can let my ninja kick 
your ninja’s butt.” 

4 


“I have to stick around to help 
Ms. Hamilton with math tutorial after 
school,” I say. “But I’ll come after dinner 
if I don’t have too much homework.” 

“Math help? Seriously?” Mason says. 
He unwraps a tasty-looking sandwich. 
“You’re such a keener, O-man.” 

“She totally cornered me,” I protest. 
“What am I going to say? No?” 

“Yeah, that’s exactly what you should 
say.” Mason takes a big bite of his sandwich. 
My attention drifts to where Kamryn 
sits with Becca farther down the wall. 

Giggling, the two girls stand. I chew 
faster once I see them moving my way. 
I don’t want to have sticky brown teeth 
if Kamryn stops to talk. 

Like she ever would. She knows 
I exist, but that’s about as deep as our 
relationship goes. 

I swallow and take a slug of water, 
swishing. Why didn’t I pick the vanilla 
Oreos this morning? 

5 


Kamryn and Becca move toward 
the stairs, talking. My heart speeds up 
when Becca stops in front of us. For one 
agonizing second I think she’s going 
to talk to me. Which might be good, 
because it would open a conversation 
with Kamryn. It also might not be good, 
because I might end up looking like a 
freak with gooey black teeth. 

Turns out I don’t have to worry. 
Neither of them notice my existence. 

Becca drops her bag and leans over 
to retie her sandal. It’s one of those 
complicated ones with the ties that crisscross 
up the leg. It looks like it might take 
her awhile. 

I keep my eyes down and listen. 

“God, you should so not borrow these 
sandals for the spring dance, Kam,” 
Becca says. “This is the third time today 
I’ve had to retie them.” 

“Yeah, but they look hot,” Kamryn 
says. “Isn’t that what matters?” 

6 


“True, it is,” says Becca. “So? Are 
you going to talk to him at the dance?” 

“Yes, and I’m so freaked out about 
it!” 

“Why?” 

“I’m still trying to figure out what to 
say,” Kamryn says. 

“Think he’s noticed you?” 

“Totally!” Kamryn exclaims. “You 
were right there when he was staring 
at me at the game last Friday. He, like, 
couldn’t take his eyes off me.” 

“But he’s in high school, Kam.” 

Becca finishes her knot with an extra 

tug and straightens. 

Kamryn’s after someone older? 

“So? He’s not that much older, Bex. 
Grade ten? Hello? That’s only two years. 
Actually, less,” she adds. “His birthday is 
in October and mine’s in March, so we’re 
really only, like, sixteen months apart.” 

At the mention of grade ten and 
October, my stomach gives a little twist. 

7 
77 


The next thing she says sends it into 
full seizure mode. 

“It’s meant to be, Bex. Think about it. 
Kyle and Kamryn? How perfect is that? 
How do we not belong together?” 

Kyle? 

I try to swallow. Beside me, Mason 
crumples up his wax paper. He reaches 
for his Coke. 

Kyle? 


“Okay, so maybe you belong 
together,” says Becca. “But how are you 
going to get together?” 

“That’s where I need a plan. And 

a superhot outfit,” Kamryn says as they 

move off. 

My stomach gives another sickening 
turn as it all sinks in. This is so wrong. 
So totally wrong. 

That grade-ten guy she’s talking 
about? The one named Kyle? 

He’s my brother. 

8 


Chapter Two 

The girl I am desperately crushing on is 

in love with my big brother. 

How am I supposed to be okay with this? 

The guy’s a jerk. I wish I could go up 
to Kamryn and tell her flat out that the 
good-looking basketball star she thinks 
is so fantastic has broken at least a dozen 
hearts in the last ten months alone. I wish 
I could tell her he’s a waste of space. 

9 


And that last guy she was with? 
Segal? He was a jerk too. 

I wish I could tell Kamryn that she 
should give me a chance. I’d treat her 
like a princess. 

Yeah, right. Like I’d ever have the 
guts to tell her something like that. 
Like she’d ever listen to me anyway. 

My afternoon crawls along. The 
seconds tick by even slower when 
I remember I’m supposed to start that 
stupid math tutoring today. 

The tutorial hour passes like a turtle 
walking backward through cement. 
Perfect squares and square roots and 
ratios. But at 3:40, I’m finally free. 

I skip the bus and decide to walk 
home. I need to think. I need to give 
my brain time to obsess about Kamryn 
trying to get together with my brother. 
My loser, jerk brother. He looks great 
on the outside, but he uses people to get 
what he wants. 

10 


How can I get what I want? 

I want to get Kamryn to like me 
instead of Kyle. But how do I do that? 

This requires serious thinking. And 
serious thinking requires serious fuel. 
I double back half a block to the 
7-Eleven. I buy a carton of milk and a 
bag of black licorice. The combination 
grosses all my friends out. But it 
works, especially when applied just 
before massive brainpower output. It’s 
gotten me through at least seven major 
exams, one prepared speech and a really 
confusing breakup with a girl who was 
way better than me at talking in circles. 

I take my sugar overdose outside 
with me and sit down on a parking block. 
I have to think. I have to come up with 
a plan to make Kamryn realize not only 
that Kyle is a weenie, but that she should 
spend her time with me instead. 

Plan A: I kill Kyle outright. Then 
I won’t have to think about him for the 

11 


rest of my life. No more awards banquets. 
No more driving around to weekend 
tournaments. No more pictures of my 
grinning brother caught up in one-armed 
hugs with sports celebrities. 

I go very still as I think about this for 
a moment. A warm feeling comes over 
me. I stop chewing and lose myself in the 
thought of a Kyle-free world. 

I blink. 

No. I can’t kill Kyle. 

The warm feeling goes away. The 
familiar knot of irritation settles back 
into place in my chest. I sigh. 

Plan B: I go right up to Kamryn and 
tell her she’s hot and that I want her in 
my world. I say that Kyle is a doofus 
who leaves poo streaks in his Jockeys. 
I tell her I am clean, kind and full of love. 

Somehow I don’t think that plan is 

going to fly. 

Something sneaky might work though. 
What if I could somehow communicate 

12 


the same basic information to Kamryn 
without her knowing it’s from me? 

I chew through three more pieces 
of licorice while I brainstorm various 
options. I remind myself that anything 
goes when you’re brainstorming. Stupid 
ideas included. 

Write an article in the newspaper 
about how Kyle sucks. (Who reads the 
newspaper?) 

Make an announcement on the radio 
about how Kyle sucks. (Really? Stupid.) 

Buy ad time on tv and make an 
ad about how Kyle sucks. (Really? 
Really really?) 

Make a YouTube video about how 
Kyle sucks. (Too revealing.) 

Write Kamryn a note about how Kyle 
sucks. (Possible. But she’ll know it’s from 
someone who’s jealous. And even if a single 
note was enough to convince her—which 
it wouldn’t be—how do I take the next step 
of showing her that I’m the right guy?) 

13 


Write Kamryn a poem about the 
kind of guy who’s perfect for her. (This 
is more promising. Girls go for poems. 
Don’t they?) 

No, not a poem. Not a note. A conversation. 
There has to be a way to engage 
Kamryn in some sort of back-and-forth. 
Then I can reel her in slowly. Get her 
to fall for me, without giving away 
my identity. 

At least, not until I’ve got her, hook, 
line and sinker. 

I think about my options here. 

Post on a blog that she reads and 
get her interested enough to leave 
a comment? Could I start the conversation 
that way? 

But how do I know what she reads? 
Her Facebook page isn’t public, so 
I can’t see her Likes. I don’t know which 
websites she reads. Which means I have 
to catch her attention—and keep her 
interested—with something new. 

14 


A website where…where what? 
What would interest an eighth-grade girl 
enough to keep her checking every day? 
Shoes? Clothes? Makeup? I don’t know 
anything about that stuff. 

Huh. What about relationships? I can 
probably make that stuff up. 

Okay. Plan C. 

Set up an anonymous blog and write a 
bunch of posts about relationships at my 
school. Write the blog like someone who 
can see the future. Get people excited about 
it so that lots of them read it. And come 
to depend on it for advice. 

And then, through the blog, I’ll convince 
Kamryn that I’m a better option than Kyle. 

I look around, excited. I think this 
could work! 

I need to think of a name. 

I think about the Big Idea, like teachers 
always tell you to do. I need a great name 
that tells people what kind of blog it is. 
It needs to say that it’s a place to go for 

15 


advice on relationships, looking into 
the future. The name should make people 
think of a crystal ball, but with more 
practical suggestions. 

I need something catchy, easy to say 
and easy to remember. 

Wizard? Nah. Wizards create magic. 
They don’t give advice. 

Muse? No. I’m not going to be 
inspiring people. 

Mystic? That sounds like I should 
be handing out green tea and crystals. 

I play with the words for a few more 
minutes, until the perfect one arrives. 
When it finally drops into my mind, I get 
one of those powerful full-body shivers. 

Oracle. 


I grin suddenly and spook a small 
child walking through the parking lot. 
He stares. 

I stand and fire my milk carton into 

the garbage. 
Let the games begin. 

16 


Chapter Three 

I settle into my chair and open up my 
laptop. I set up my blog name. Oracle. 

I set up the About page with a picture 
of an ancient temple. Then I write my 
bio. I’m careful to keep it anonymous 
while still letting it be known that I’m 
a member of the school community. 

By day, I’m a student at LaMontagne. 
You know me, but I know you even better. 

17 


Call me the Oracle. Here’s where 
you’ll find direction in life and love at 
LaMontagne. 

I pause. Yeah, but how do I give 
that direction? How do I get people to 
leave comments so that I can get the 
conversation started? 

I start typing again. Want to find 
your soul mate? Wondering how 
to make that cute guy or girl fall 
head over heels for you? Need tips 
to get that first conversation started? 
Ask the Oracle. 

I decide to write a post and then 
answer it with a comment. Then it’ll 
look like someone has already asked 
the Oracle questions. 

So, then, I’ll post about…what? 

My shoulders slump. I’ve hit a wall. 
I can’t just make up stories about the 
people at LaMontagne. I can’t use names. 
I can’t write about my own situation, 
because I’ll give myself away. 

18 


I type relationship advice into 
Google. Twenty-nine million hits! 
I dive in and read Q&As on different 
websites. After a few minutes of reading, 
I find a question that will work perfectly. 
My boyfriend and I have been going out 
for five months. We used to talk all the time. 
Now he doesn’t return my calls. He says 
he’s just busy with soccer season. Should 
I keep calling him? 

I don’t even need to read the answer 
to know that the guy’s trying to tell her 
it’s over. 

This is so easy! I can basically copy 
and paste questions and answers. This 
won’t take me very long at all. 

I click on New Post. My grin slides 
off my face when the hole in my plan 
becomes obvious. 

I can’t keep posting random questions 
and answering them. If I want this thing 
to get off the ground, I have to find a way to 
get other people to submit questions. 

19 


Which is impossible, since no one 
knows the blog exists. 

I sigh in frustration. How can this be 
so complicated? 

I stand up, suddenly needing to get 
out of here. I slip on a hoodie and stuff 
my phone into my pocket. I grab my 
skateboard and a couple of bucks for 
a Slurpee. 

When the going gets tough, I go for 
a skate. 

I’m still stumped when I roll into the 
7-Eleven. 

I kick up my board with one hand and 
grab for the door handle with the other. 

I yank the door open without looking. 
From inside the store comes the sound of 
girls chattering. 

By the time I feel the weight of 
someone leaning on the other side of the 
door, it’s already halfway open. I stagger 

20 


backward as someone crashes into 
my chest. 

“Oof!” My breath punches out of me. 
Reflexively, my arms come up. I drop 
my board. It clatters to the concrete. Cold 
slushy stuff hits my arm and stomach. I find 
myself in an unexpected hug with I’m-notsure-
who. The Slurpee on my shirt soaks 
through, freezing my stomach against 
whoever I’m now holding in my arms. 

The chatter turns to gasps. 

“Oh my god! Kamryn!” a girl’s voice 
shrieks. “Are you okay?” 

Kamryn? Oh crap. 


I shrink back like I’ve been burned. 
In my clumsy scramble to push our bodies 
apart, my hands land on something soft. 
Really soft. 

Kamryn squeals in outrage. 

I realize in horror where my palms 
have landed. 

“Sorry! I’m sorry!” I shout. I snatch my 
hands away, upsetting her balance again. 

21 


She stumbles forward, and our heads bonk. 
Oh my god, could this get any worse? 

Dana grabs for Kamryn to steady her. 
She narrows her eyes at me. “Look where 
you’re going, you idiot,” she sneers. 

The air is filled with exclamations 
as Kamryn’s friends flutter around her. 
They throw me dirty scowls. 

Her balance finally restored, Kamryn 
glares at me. If she never noticed me 
before, she’ll sure remember me now. 
She smooths her hair back, her chin 
jutting. “Don’t you ever touch me 
again,” she hisses. Her glare could break 
apart diamonds. 

“I wasn’t…” I fumble. “I didn’t 
mean…” I shake my head and take 
a step back. 

My foot lands on my skateboard. 
The wheels engage, sliding easily along 
the concrete. I go sprawling backward. 
My leg overcompensates, pushing the 
board forward. Horrified, I watch as it 

22 


shoots out from under me and slams into 
Kamryn’s shin. She gasps and clutches 
at her leg. 

Apparently, it can get worse. 

Kamryn’s eyes narrow into sharp slits 
of glittering green. She is just getting 
ready to slay me when the door behind 
her opens. 

“Owen. Hey.” I look up to see 
Hannah, the president of the student 
council. She looks surprised but wary. 
“Everything okay?” 

Kamryn straightens and glances at 
Hannah. She doesn’t say whatever she’d 
planned to say to me. Not in front of 
Hannah, at least. Everyone likes Hannah. 
She’s always nice, always honest, but 
funny and cool at the same time. People 
want her to think well of them. 

Kamryn gives me a final glare. Her 
friends close around her, and they move 
away, talking. Kamryn is waving her 
hands and shaking her head. I’m sure 

23 


she’s telling everyone how stupid I am 
for opening the door. 

Never mind that she was leaning on it, 
not looking where she was going. 

Hannah watches the receding group. 
“What was that all about?” 

I shake my head. “She crashed into 
me when I opened the door,” I say. “And 
now she’s got a full hate-on for me.” 

Hannah sighs. “I wouldn’t worry 
about it too much, Owen,” she says. 
“It’s pretty hard to stay in Kamryn’s 
good books.” 

She sticks a hand out, and I take it. 
“Thanks,” I say. She pulls me up, and I 
dust off my butt. My shirt is cold and wet, 
and it sticks to my stomach. Gross. 

But as I look at Hannah, it hits 
me. I think I’ve found a solution to 
my problem. 

24 


Chapter Four 

“Tell me again why you’re doing this?” 
Hannah asks. 

I upend my board and grab it by the 
trucks. We climb the front stairs of my 
house. “’Cause. It’ll be fun.” I jiggle 
my key in the old brass lock. The door 
swings open, and I step into the entryway. 

Hannah doesn’t follow. She stays 
on the doorstep, arms folded. “Owen.” 

25 


Only Hannah has that way of saying my 
name. “Flash mobs are fun. Parasailing 
is fun. But writing a relationship blog? 
This doesn’t sound like you. What’s 
going on?” 

Crap. She’s not buying it. She’ll 
laugh if I tell her the real reason behind 
the Oracle. Especially after what she 
witnessed today. 

I shrug. “I want to see how many 
people I can get to read it.” I motion 
for her to come in. She stands in the 
doorway, stubbornly. 

I sigh and push her out of the way 
so I can close the door. Hannah’s not 
someone most people can push out of the 
way. But I can. We’ve been friends since 
our mothers met at baby music class 
thirteen years ago. I’ve seen Hannah 
barf all down her best dress. She’s seen 
me pee my pants. Twice. 

Hannah furrows her dark brows. “You 
want to see how many people read it?” 

26 


she repeats. “Really? Owen, when was the 
last time you wrote more than ten words 
in a row? What’s with the sudden urge to 
host an entire”—she looks for the right 
word—“gossip blog for our school?” 

I put my arm around her shoulders. 
“I don’t plan to do it all alone,” I say. 
“You’re going to help me.” 

“I’m going to help you?” She looks at 
me like I’m speaking Finnish. “I haven’t 
agreed to anything.” 

“Ah, but you’re brilliant, Hannah,” 
I say, laying it on thick. “Your ideas are 
way better than mine. Your research skills 
are tops. Plus, you’re funny.” 

Never mind that I’m too lazy to make 
the blog happen by myself. I need her 
help to get it up and running. 

I head for the kitchen. I don’t want to 
appear desperate. I’ll lose ground if she 
thinks it matters too much. 

She follows me into the kitchen, her 
arms still crossed. I take two packages 

27 


of cookies out of the cupboard and hand 
one to her. She shakes her head and takes 
an apple from the fruit bowl instead. 

“Are you going to tell me what this 
is really all about?” she says, polishing 
her apple on her jeans. 

I sigh. Hannah can’t be dodged. She 
knows me way too well. I go straight to 
the heart of it. “Kamryn’s in love with 
my brother.” 

“So?” 

“Well, Kyle’s a jerk. You know that.” 

“I do know that,” says Hannah. “But 
I don’t see what a blog has to do with it.” 
She takes a bite of apple. 

“I want to use it to steer her away 
from him.” 

“How’s that going to work?” she 
asks. 

I shrug. “Post misleading love advice 
and get Kamryn to read it.” 

Hannah regards me suspiciously. 
“What’s it to you who Kamryn likes?” 

28 


Ah. This is where it gets tricky. 
I don’t want to tell my best friend 
that I’m crushing hard on the most 
popular girl in our grade. I’m afraid 
she’ll tell me I don’t stand a chance 
with Kamryn. Or worse, she’ll laugh. 
Hannah’s not one to keep her opinions 
to herself. 

I shrug again. “It’s more about not 
letting Kyle have the satisfaction of yet 
another girl wasting her love on him.” 

Hannah peels the sticker off the apple 

and flattens it on the counter. “You should 

let Kyle have her,” she says. “They’d be 

perfect for each other.” 

“What do you mean?” 

Hannah shrugs. 

“What?” I ask again. 

But she doesn’t say anything else. 

I say, “I think my idea could work. 
Plus it would be fun to get the school 
hooked on a relationship blog.” 

“But it’s bogus!” Hannah protests. 

29 


I shake my head. “Only the Kamryn-
Kyle posts,” I say. “The rest of it can be 
legit. Real advice.” 

Hannah sighs. “What if you put all 
that energy into skating instead, Owen? 
Or helping me organize the Free the 
Children Gala?” 

“Come on,” I say. “How much fun 
would it be to mess with a thousand 
people’s heads like this?” 

Her eyes get a faraway look. 

Good. She’s thinking about it. 

When she looks back at me, I raise an 
eyebrow. I move in for the kill. Playing 
on her do-gooder side. “Think of all the 
lives you’d be touching,” I say. “You could 
really help people…find love and all that.” 

She tilts her head. “It would be kind 
of fun to see the response it gets.” 

“So you’re in?” 

“I’m not saying I’ll write anything.” 

“So you’re in?” I repeat, giving her 
leg a little nudge with my foot. 

30 


“You could get in big trouble if this 
ever gets out, Owen.” 

“It won’t. I’ll make sure of it.” 

Hannah looks up at the ceiling and 
releases a long, slow breath. When she 
looks back at me, there’s a gleam in 
her eye. 

“I’m in.” 

31 


Chapter Five 

I lean back in my chair. “What number 
are we up to?” 

It’s Sunday afternoon. Hannah’s on my 
bed with her laptop open. She studies the 
sheet where we keep track of user names 
and passwords. The “phantom people” 
who write to the Oracle for advice. 

“Seventeen. Both questions and 
answers.” She consults the sheet. “We’ve 

32 


got the messy breakup, the cheating 
girlfriend, the jealous lover, the gay who’s 
afraid to come out, the hopeless romantic, 
the fetishist—” 

“I liked that one. Sneaker Sniffer.” 
I stretch. “Let’s do one about Kamryn and 
Kyle now.” 

“Ugh.” Hannah rolls her eyes. “Fine.” 
She starts typing, setting up a new phantom 
email for the question writer. “Number 
eighteen,” she says. “I’ll call her QB.” 

“Quintessential babe?” 

Hannah stares. “You think Kamryn’s a 
babe?” Her laugh is short. “Holy, you’re 
just like everyone else.” 

I realize my mistake. “Well, I myself 
don’t think she’s a babe,” I scramble. 
“I mean, not personally.” 

Hannah looks back down at her laptop. 
“Whatever. QB stands for Queen Bee.” 

She looks mad. I’m not sure what 
to say. Usually if Hannah’s mad about 
something, you hear about it. 

33 


But she doesn’t say anything else. 
I keep us moving along. 
“Okay, so. Our question for Kamryn 


could be, How do I get this really hot guy 
to notice me?” 

Hannah starts typing.A few seconds 
later, she hits a button. “Sent,” she 
says. 

I click Refresh on my laptop, and the 
question appears on my screen as though 
QB actually wrote in to ask the Oracle 
about it. 

I grab my head and groan. 

“What?” Hannah asks. 

“Epic problem,” I say. 

“What?” she asks again. 

“I want to give her the wrong advice 
and steer her in the wrong direction,” 
I say. “But the Oracle isn’t supposed to 
give bad advice. It’s supposed to give 
good advice.” 

“Oh,” Hannah says. “Riiiiiight.” 

We sit for a few moments. 

34 


Then Hannah snaps her fingers. 
“Got it,” she says. 

“What?” 

“We write in as Kyle.” 

I stare at her. “We write in as Kyle?” 
I can’t imagine my brother reading 
a website about relationships, let alone 
writing in to ask for advice. But Kamryn 
won’t know that. 

“What would Kyle ask?” I say. 

“Dear Oracle,” Hannah begins. She 
types as she talks. 

“I’m in grade ten. There’s this grade-
eight girl who’s driving me crazy. She 
has a crush on me, but the feeling isn’t 
mutual. She’s on the prowl and won’t let 
up. She’s even got plans to hunt me down 
at the spring dance.” 

My jaw drops, and I swivel in my 
chair. “That’s so obvious!” 

Hannah looks at me. “Owen. Do you 
want her to figure it out or what?” 

“Right. Obvious it is.” 

35 


She finishes. “Oracle, I’m not 
interested in dating little kids. How do 
I tell her to leave me alone?” 

I can’t help it. I laugh. “That’s 
perfect! If Kamryn reads that question, 
she’ll totally think Kyle wrote it. She’ll 
get the message loud and clear.” I lean 
back and punch Hannah on the shoulder. 
“You’re a genius.” 

“I know.” She shrugs and twirls 

a length of hair around a finger. “Your 

world would be dead and meaningless 
without me.” 

I laugh again. “You realize, don’t you, 
that if people start reading this website, 
we can totally direct their behavior with 
questions and answers?” 

Hannah nods. “Supreme power.” 

“That’s pretty cool. To have this much 
control over people.” 

“Controlling minds is pretty cool,” she 
agrees. “Except there’s one tiny problem.” 

36 


“What’s that?” 

“How do we get people to read it?” 

“You do the main floor. I’ll do upstairs.” 
I hand Hannah a fistful of blue business 

cards. 

She heads down the corridor, 
slipping a card into every few lockers. 
The hallways are quiet except for the 
mad-science nerds and a few people in 
the drama club. Almost everyone has gone 
home or to the gym to watch the game. 

Hannah and I stayed up late last night 
creating anonymous identities. Inventing 
questions and posting answers and 
having way too much fun. 

As of today, the Oracle is open 
for business. 

I take my bundle of cards upstairs. 
Between us, we have three hundred. 
It’s not enough for every locker at 

37 


LaMontagne, but it’s a good start for 
getting the word out. 

I glance down at the card. It shows a 
dark sky full of stars swirling around an 
image of an ancient temple. In gold are 
the words, Is love in the stars for you at 
LaMontagne? Ask the Oracle. The url 
is at the bottom. 

It should get people’s attention. 

I save the last card for Kamryn’s 
locker, at the far end of the east wing. If 
nothing else, I have to make sure she gets 
one. She’s the whole reason for the Oracle. 

As I drop the card through a small 
opening at the top of the locker, it hits 
me that I should have written a personal 
message on it. An invitation, or maybe 
a hint about Kyle. Something to make 
sure she logs on and checks out the site. 
I duck my head to feel around at the 
bottom of the locker, but there’s no way 
I’m retrieving the card. 

That was dumb. 

38 


I pull on the locker. Locked, of 
course. I bang my forehead against it 
in frustration. 

Hannah rounds the corner. “This is 
going to be so great!” she says. She stops 
short when she sees me. “What on earth 
are you doing?” 

I straighten guiltily. “Nothing.” 

“Why were you smashing your head 
against…” Hannah pulls back and scans 
the row of lockers. “Kamryn’s locker?” 
she finishes. When she looks back at me, 
her eyes are suspicious. A locker slams 
in the next hallway. 

“Oh, is this her locker?” I feign 
surprise. “That’s weird. I, uh, didn’t have 
enough cards to get to the end of this row. 
I was just thinking that maybe we didn’t 
print enough.” 

I can tell she doesn’t believe me. 

She opens her mouth to speak. 

Mason rounds the corner, wearing 
those jumbo foam hands people wave 

39 


at hockey games. He stops and points, 
cowboy-style, when he sees us. “Dudes,” 
he says. “What’re you doing up here? 
Game’s in the gym.” 

Hannah looks at Mason, then at me. 

“We were just headed there,” she 
says. “Let’s go.” 

40 


Chapter Six 

The next day after school, I check the 
Oracle’s stats. 

If I wasn’t sitting down already, 
I would have fallen on the floor. The 
site had two hundred and twenty-three 
hits and forty-eight comments. 

My stomach does a flip-flop. 

What? 

41 


My heart hammers. I should be 
happy, but instead I feel like I’ve been 
buried by an avalanche. 

What have I started? 

What am I going to do with forty-eight 
questions? How will I answer them all? 

I run my hands through my hair, then 
click on the first one. 

Dear Oracle. My best friend just 
broke up with her boyfriend. I’m really 
attracted to him and want to go out 
with him, But I don’t want my friend to 
be upset. What do I do? —LF 

I blink. Wow, that’s a tough one. 

Maybe the next question will be 
easier to answer. I click on it. 

Dear Oracle. Is it a good idea to kiss 
on the first date? My friends and I can’t 
agree. —To Kiss or Not to Kiss 

I don’t know. Is it a good idea? 

Let’s have a look at number three. 

Dear Oracle. I’m going out with a 
guy that I’m not interested in anymore. 

42 


How do I dump him gently? —Softhearted 

Ah, man. Who was I to think I could 
manage a gig like this? 

I go through every question to see if 
any of them are easy to answer. 

None are, except for the one asking 
about poisoning an ex’s new girlfriend 
with formaldehyde from the chem lab. 
I write a stern reply discouraging the 
idea. Before I hit Send I suggest itching 
powder in her gym shorts instead. 

I drop my head into my hands. I’ve told 
everyone the Oracle can solve their trickiest 
relationship issues. And, other than telling 
people not to kill each other, I don’t have 
a clue where to start. 

The doorbell rings, making me jump. 

“Forty-eight questions!” Hannah says 
when I open the door. She’s obviously 
checked the stats too. 

“I know,” I groan. “I have no idea 
how to answer them either.” 

Hannah grins. “I do.” 

43 


“What? How?” 

“Horoscopes.” 

“Horoscopes?” 

She nods. “Astrology. You ask people 
to send in the birthdate of the person 
they’re asking about. It’s the best tool 
we have to tailor the Oracle’s advice 
to that person.” 

“I’m not following you.” 

Hannah steps inside and closes 
the door. 

“You’re a Sagittarius, right?” she 
asks. 

“I don’t know. Am I?” 

“Yes, you are. Your birthday is 
December eighth.” She starts walking 
toward my bedroom. 

I follow her. “Okay. So what?” 

“Well, according to the ancient art 
of astrology, there are certain things 
a person can do if he or she wants to woo 
someone of a particular sign.” 

“Keep talking.” 

44 


“Well, let’s use you as an example,” 
she says, settling herself on my bed. 
“Sagittarians are honest, and they 
have a great sense of humor. So good 
relationship advice for someone who’s 
in love with a Sagittarius is to show that 
you can be a lot of fun. Or that you like 
the outdoors. Or horses.” 

I look at Hannah. “How’d you get so 
wise on astrology all of a sudden?” 

Hannah pulls out a folded sheet of 
paper and waves it at me. “Google.” She 
opens the sheet and runs her finger down 
a list, reading. “More on Sagittarius. 
Optimistic. Adventurous. You like to 
travel. You think about the future. You 
don’t like to be tied down.” 

I laugh and sit down. “No comment. 
What’s your sign?” 

“I’m a Leo,” she says. 

“What’s that mean?” 

She raises an eyebrow. “Flatter me.” 

“Anything else?” 

45 


“That’s all you need to know for 
Leos,” says Hannah. 

“Okay, so…you’re brilliant,” I say. 

“Tell me something I don’t know.” 

“You have lovely, uh…hair?” 

“Getting warmer.” She laughs. I love 
making Hannah laugh. Her laugh makes 
me feel good. 

“You have a laugh that I could listen 
to all day?” I say. 

Hannah stops laughing. She blinks, 
twice, then looks down. 

The air in the room feels different all 
of a sudden. The tops of my ears grow hot. 

I hear Hannah take in a little breath. 
Then she nods toward the laptop. “We 
should get started. We need to get the 
word out so people can write in with 
actual birthdates.” 

“Right.” I nod. “But wait. How are 
people supposed to know other people’s 
birthdates? You can’t go up to a girl or 
guy you like and ask them what their 

46 


birthday is. That’s too obvious. They’d 
know you were writing a question for 
the Oracle.” 

Hannah leans over my shoulder. She 
smells good. Like vanilla. And fruit. 

With a couple of clicks, she brings up 
a familiar blue page. 

“Facebook, silly.” 

The girl is brilliant. Of course! Everyone 
puts their birthday on their page. 

“Awesome! You are so smart!” 

She shrugs and studies her nails 
modestly. “I try.” 

I open up a new post and start typing. 

Dear Readers. I am truly delighted that 
so many of you have written in with your 
questions. As I see it, to receive the most 
accurate advice possible, please include 
the birthdate of the individual in question. 

“That’s going to cause problems,” 
Hannah says, looking over my shoulder. 

“I thought you said that was the 
best way to do it?” I say. “If we have 

47 


the people’s birthdates, we can tailor the 
advice better, right?” 

“But if they write the birthdate right 
into their comment,” Hannah says, 
“everyone who reads it can figure out 
who they’re talking about.” 

“Ohhh,” I say. “Hadn’t thought 
of that. Well. What if they post the 
question in the comments, and then 
send it to us again in an email? With the 
birthdate included?” 

Hannah’s eyes brighten. “Email’s 
private. That would totally work.” 

I add, Of course, you won’t want 
to put the birthdate in your comment. 
Unless you want your secret longings 
to become public! Post your comment, 
then send it to me again in an email at 
oracle98@gmail.com. Be sure to include 
your would-be’s birthdate. 

“Good?” I ask. 

“Excellent,” she answers. 

48 


I click Publish. 

“Now for today’s questions,” Hannah 
says. 

I roll my eyes. “Ugh. There’s forty-
eight!” I say. 

Hannah glances back at the screen. 
“Fifty-six, actually. Look.” 

I don’t look. “That’s way too many 
to answer,” I moan. 

“Who says we have to answer all of 
them?” Hannah asks. “It’s not like people 
are paying for this. They can wait their 
turn. Actually, a wait might stoke the 

fires.” She gives me a half smile. 
“I’m not so sure I can handle this fire 

getting stoked any higher,” I say. 

That came out weird. I feel my ears start 
to burn again. Hannah’s face goes pink. 

Her next words save me from putting 
my foot any farther into my mouth. 
“Why don’t we just pick the five best and 
answer those?” 

49 


I stare at her. The five best. It’s perfect. 

I want to hug her. 
But I don’t. 

I nod. “Okay. Five. We can do five. 

Where do we start?” 

50 


Chapter Seven 

At school, everyone is talking about the 
Oracle. I catch snippets of conversation 
all through the day. 

“Did you read the one from SS?” 
“That the shoe chick?” 
“Yeah, Sneaker Sniffer.” 
“I wonder who that could be? Weird 


thing to get off on.” 
I resist the urge to smile. 

51 


People are still talking about the site 
when I head to math help after school. 

I’m helping a guy in grade seven 
apply the order of operations when a bag 
skids onto the table beside me. A book 
slaps down on the tabletop, then a phone, 
then a pencil. And finally, Kamryn flops 
into the chair across from me with a 
dramatic sigh. Two grade-seven girls at 
a nearby table stare as the goddess makes 
her entrance. 

My heart does a complete somersault 
before coming back to rest in the center 
of my body. “Hi,” I say, before I can 
decide against it. 

“This is stupid,” she says. Her eyes 
move around the room. 

“Actually, it’s math help,” I say. The 
grade-seven kid chuckles. 

Kamryn narrows her eyes and lets 
them rest on me. I force myself to meet 
her gaze. It’s green. And cold. 

My love is like to ice and I to fire. 

52 


“I mean, being here is stupid,” she 
says. “It’s a waste of time.” 

I can’t help it. My natural habit of 
arguing—honed from years of living 
with a jerk brother—surfaces. “Door’s 
over there.” I nod toward it. 

I want to kick myself as soon as the 
words hit the air. How long have I wanted 
to get Kamryn in my orbit? And now 
that I have her sitting across from me, 
I suggest that she leave? 

“I can’t leave,” she growls. “Stupid old 
Saddlebags won’t let me. She said I had 
to come. Otherwise I fail this semester.” 

I steal a glance toward Ms. Hamilton’s 
desk, hoping she didn’t overhear. But 
she’s not even in the room. “Saddlebags?” 

Kamryn fixes me with a withering 
glare. “Yeah, Saddlebags. That would be 
our fat, ugly math teacher with the huge 
butt that drips down the sides of her legs.” 

I’d laugh at Kamryn’s words if her 
delivery weren’t so mean. The grade-seven 

53 


kid beside me laughs again. Kamryn 
looks away, mad that her sarcasm 
is wasted on a couple of nerds. 

“Listen,” she says and looks right at 
me. “Can you just show me how to do 
this? Then I can get out of here.” She flips 
open her binder and pulls out a sheet of 
paper. A pop quiz. Zero out of six. She 
slides the paper across the table at me and 
taps it with her pencil. Twice. Tap tap. 

I look at the pencil. At the nicely 

shaped nails attached to the fingers that 

are holding the pencil. And I look up, at 
Kamryn’s face. Her stunning, beautiful, 

flawless face. She’s not looking at me 

anymore. She’s looking at the clock 
over my head. 

Ice. 

“Sure,” I say. “Just let me finish this 

problem with Matteo.” 

Kamryn’s eyes slide back to my face. 
She looks confused. “Can’t you do it now?” 
She wiggles the paper a bit. “Come on, 

54 


I’ve got to be somewhere.” She dips 
her chin a bit and raises one eyebrow, 
coaxing me. “Please?” She blinks twice 
and smiles. “You owe me anyway, from 
last week. At the 7-Eleven.” 

I look at her. My tongue ties itself 
up in a knot. A hundred thoughts crowd 
my brain. That she’s perfect. That 
she shouldn’t try to butt in front of 
other people, because it’s not fair. That 
my shirt still bears the stains from her 
Coke Slurpee. 

But, of course, I don’t tell her any of 
those things. 

Matteo solves the problem for me. 
He’s a pretty cool kid, and he’s obviously 
not scared of Kamryn. 

“Owen’s helping me right now,” 
Matteo says. “You’ll have to wait your 
turn.” 

The girls at the next table send up a 
muted gasp at his daring. Who in their 
right mind sasses Kamryn Holt? 

55 


Kamryn’s face folds in and pinches 
up. Her lips thin as she turns to Matteo. 
“I’m sorry. Were you talking to me?” 

“I was, yes.” Matteo nods. His voice 
is thin and nasal. He meets her gaze 
straight on. “I said that Owen’s almost 
finished showing me how these brackets 
work. Then I’m sure he’d be delighted 
to help you. Wouldn’t you, Owen?” 

He’s absolutely right. But still, 
I feel caught. 

I don’t answer. 

Kamryn stares at Matteo for a few 
seconds. He stares right back. The room 
is silent as a snowdrift as she makes up 
her mind whether she’s going to admit 
defeat or escalate the drama. 

She chooses both. 

In one angry movement, her hand 
flashes forward. She snatches the paper 
Matteo and I have been using and crumples 
it. With a dismissive little hiss, she drops 
the wadded-up paper on the table. 

56 


She pushes her chair back from the 
table. “I don’t wait,” she says. She looks 
around the room. “I don’t need to practice 
math with a bunch of retards either.” 

At the word retard, my anger flares. 
I have an autistic cousin. But even 
if I didn’t, I still hate people using that 
word as a put-down. Doesn’t matter how 
perfect they are. 

Kamryn slings her bag over her 
shoulder. She gathers up her book and 
phone and flounces from the room. 
She slams the door hard enough to shake 
the windows in their panes. 

The girls let out a collective breath. 
Matteo picks up his crumpled paper. 
My mouth, which had opened to say 
something about the retard comment, 
snaps shut. 

“Wow, Matteo, you really made her 
mad,” says one of the girls. 

“That was awesome!” whispers 
the other. 

57 


“She’s a cow,” Matteo says. “I don’t 
know why people let her get away 
with it.” He carefully flattens his paper 
against the tabletop and scoots his chair 
closer. He appears entirely unfazed by the 
whole interaction. The girls are eyeing 
him with a new appreciation. 

“So, yeah, anyway,” he says to me, 
holding his pencil over his paper. “Do 
you mind showing me again? From the 
beginning?” 

58 


Chapter Eight 

By the following week, Hannah and 

I have upped our allotment to fifteen 

questions a day. People are going nuts 
over the Oracle. 

The routine goes like this. I read 
Hannah the questions. Most days, there 
are between ten and twenty. We choose 
which ones to answer based on how 
much information we have. Hannah does 

59 


the horoscope research, and I compile the 
answers.All told, it’s about an hour’s work. 

Today we get our first feedback. 

“Listen to this,” I say. 

“Listening.” Hannah is stretched 
out on my bed watching a Leo forecast 
on YouTube. 

“No, you’re not.” 

She sighs and presses Pause. “Okay. 
I am now.” 

I read, “Dear Oracle. That girl 
I wanted to ask out last week? I took 
your advice and used little cut-up bits of 
magazines to spell out the words to ask 
her out on a date. I said, ‘Want to go check 
out the art gallery?’and then I gave it to 
her at the end of break. And you know 
what? She loved it. She said she didn’t 
know any other guy who would take her 
to a gallery on a first date. Thanks!” 

“Aw, that is so sweet,” Hannah says. 
“Owen, you’re a matchmaker now!” 
She pats my back. 

60 


“It’s not me,” I say. “It’s the 
horoscopes. And you,” I add, with a 
half shrug. 

Hannah blushes. “Read me today’s 
questions.” 

“Well, I’ve already drafted a response 
to this one,” I say. “This one’s kind 
of heavy.” I glance at her. “There’s some 
messed-up kids out there.” 

Her brow furrows. “Read it.” 

“It’s from someone called Losing 
Hope,” I begin. “Dear Oracle. I can’t 
take it anymore. Last night my dad 
got really angry with me. Again. He 
was drinking. He was mad because 
I didn’t have enough money to go buy 
him cigarettes.” 

Hannah sits up. “What?” 
I keep reading. 
“So he broke all the dishes, one 


by one. And then he made me clean up 
the mess. With my hands.” 

“What?” Hannah whispers. 

61 


I finish the note. “I don’t know what 
to do. If I run away, I’ll end up living 
on the streets. I’m seriously thinking 
about just ending it all. Maybe I can start 
over in another lifetime.” 

I turn to Hannah. “Signed, Losing 
Hope.” 

Hannah swallows. “Someone actually 
had that happen to them?” 

I nod slowly. “Someone at our 
school.” 

“Who?” she asks. Her question hangs 
in the air, heavy and sad. 

I shake my head. “Who knows?” 

“What did you tell her?” Hannah’s 
voice quavers. 

“Kids’ Help Phone,” I say. “As a 
first step. I also googled teen depression 
domestic violence and came up with 
a number for the National Domestic 
Violence Hotline.” 

Hannah shudders. She stares down at 
her hands. I know she, like me, will spend 

62 


tomorrow looking for people with cuts 
on their hands. 

“And,” I add, “I said she had to tell 
someone at school—a trusted adult. 
Maybe a teacher or the counselor. I said 
there’s people who can help, and there 
are safe places to go.” 

Hannah nods. “I hope she’s okay,” 
she whispers. She looks out my window. 

“I hope so too,” I say. And I really 
do. I think about how kids like that 
don’t often report abuse because 
they don’t want their parents to get 
in trouble. So they take it. Until they 
can’t take it anymore. 

I don’t want Losing Hope to be like 
that. I’ll check in with her again sometime 
soon. See how she’s doing. Whether she’s 
reached out to someone yet. 

I glance back at Hannah. “Do you 
need to take a break?” I ask. 

She takes a deep breath and shakes her 
head. “No, we can go on.” She pauses. 

63 


“I think you did a good job on that 
one. There’s not much else you can do 
right now.” 

I shrug. “I wish I could do more.” 

“Let’s keep an eye out for when 
Losing Hope surfaces again,” she says. 
“I hope she does.” 

I nod. “Me too.” 

64 


Chapter Nine 

“Keep reading,” Hannah says. 

I read a dozen questions out loud. 
When I get to the last one, my heart skips 
a beat. Skips about eleven beats, actually. 
Maybe twelve. 

It’s signed Heart Huntress. 

I take in a long breath. “Whoooee,” 
I say. “Here we go.” 

“What?” 

65 


“Kamryn has finally written in.” 

Instantly, Hannah appears behind me. 
She reads aloud over my shoulder. “Dear 
Oracle. The guy I want is older than me by 
a couple of grades, but I know we’d be 
perfect together. He’s already noticed me, 
and I think he likes what he sees. Here’s 
my question. I’m going to see him again at 
the dance this week, and I want that to be the 
night I capture his heart. I need your advice, 
from how to make my grand entrance until 
the moment I nail that first kiss.” 

“Huh,” I say. “She didn’t understand 
that message we wrote as Kyle. Or she 
didn’t realize it was directed at her.” 

“I’m not surprised,” Hannah says. 

“What do you mean?” 

“Honestly, Owen,” Hannah says. 
She sounds exasperated. “Kamryn 
thinks she’s above it all. If everyone 
else thinks she’s perfect, why wouldn’t 
she? She has no reason to imagine 
that she can’t get exactly what she wants. 

66 


It would never occur to her that the post 

was written by Kyle.” 

“It wasn’t,” I point out. 

Hannah groans. “You know what 
I mean!” 

I grin and open my Gmail. “Anyway, 
we need to redirect her. Tell her to do all 
the wrong things so she turns Kyle off.” 

“Heavy perfume,” Hannah offers. 
“Lots of makeup. Thick, heavy lipstick, 
especially.” 

I recoil in mock horror. “Gross!” 

“Well?” Hannah asks. “You want 
ways to turn guys off, don’t you?” 

I check for Kamryn’s message that 
contains the birthdate of the guy in question. 
Sure enough, she’s copied the same 
message but added Birthday October 30th. 

“October thirtieth,” I say. “That’s 
Kyle.” 

“Ooh, he’s a Scorpio,” says Hannah. 
“Sexiest sign in the zodiac.” Her voice 
is teasing. 

67 


“You can’t be serious.” I can’t even 
think about it. Kyle? Sexy? The guy gets 
those silverfish bugs in his toothbrush 
because it’s so dirty. 

“But Scorpios can be really mean,” 
she adds. 

“That’s more like it.” 

“I don’t know why you want to mess 
with karma on this one.” Hannah sighs. 
“Kyle’s a perfect fit for Kamryn. Mean 
deserves mean.” 

I roll my eyes. “Oh my god,” I say. 
“She’s not that bad. You’ve got some 
weird vendetta against Kamryn.” 

“Um, excuse me?” Hannah says. 
“You were the one who told me how 
she shot Matteo down in flames during 
your tutorial.” 

I shrug. “Maybe she was having a 
bad day.” 

“Oh right. That day, and the time at 
7-Eleven? Come on, Owen. I know what 
she’s like.” 

68 


“Why do you always have to come 
down so hard on her?” I ask. 

“Why are you so eager to excuse 
her crappy behavior?” Hannah shoots 
back. “Wait, no, I know. Because you’re 
in love.” She holds both hands over her 
heart and flutters her eyelashes. 

Normally, I’d laugh off her teasing. 
But sudden hot anger spills into my 
throat. I’m mad that she thinks I’m 
an idiot for liking Kamryn. 

But I’m also mad at myself, because 
a little part of me knows she’s right. 

I say the first thing I can think of that 

will hurt. “You’re right, Hannah. I am in 

love with Kamryn.” 

Hannah goes very still. 

I drive the knife in a little deeper. 
“And that makes you crazy, doesn’t it? 
Maybe you’re jealous.” 

She flinches. Immediately, I regret my 
words. I open my mouth, searching for 
a way to take them back. 

69 


“Hannah,” I say. 

But it’s too late. I watch, helpless, 
as she gathers her laptop and bag. 

“Hannah, listen.” 

The handle makes a soft click as the 
door closes behind her. 

I stare at the screen for a long time 
after she’s gone. What did I say all that 
for? I’ve embarrassed Hannah and made 
her feel terrible. 

Holy. Who’s the mean one now? 

A new comment drops in as I’m 
sitting there. It jolts me out of my 
trance. 

I’m on my own now. Guess I’d better 
get going. 

I ignore the new question and start 
with Kamryn’s instead. A few minutes 
ago, I was excited. Finally! My long-
awaited chance to steer Kamryn away 
from Kyle! 

But my fingers feel frozen as I type 

my reply. 

70 


Dear Huntress. As I see it, your 
would-be is already in love with another 
young woman. But the stars show me that 
the universe is unfolding as it should. 

Those words seem familiar. They just 
kind of typed themselves out onto the 
page. I wonder where I’ve heard those 
before? Maybe in a poem. 

I shrug and continue. 

While you may believe deeply in 
your wish to be united with this guy, my 
observations show me a more powerful 
match in a young man closer to your 
age. The clouds obscure my sight from 
complete clarity, but I sense that this 
individual is— 

Is what? In grade eight? Wears jeans 
and zombie T-shirts? That’s a bit too clear. 

I think about where Kamryn and 
I cross paths. The only place I can think 
of where we’ve actually exchanged 
words and glances—besides outside the 
convenience store—is in math help. 

71 


I go back to my reply. I sense that this 
individual is logical in nature. I see you 
meeting him outside class time, perhaps in 
an extracurricular session. He is helping 
you with something. There is some numeric 
energy there, but I can’t quite pinpoint it. 

I wonder if this is too tea-leafy. 
Or whether the numeric bit is too obvious. 
But what do I have to lose? 

Try exploring that avenue. Good luck. 

I take a deep breath and hit Publish. 

I turn my attention to the list of 
waiting questions. Methodically, I work 
my way through them, check traits 
against zodiac signs and design my 
advice to suit. I don’t rush any of them. 
I even throw in a bit of my own advice 
when I think it’ll be helpful. 

In between questions, I think about 
my response to Kamryn. I wonder if it’s 
going to work. 

I sigh. Whatever. It’s out there now. 
Time will tell where it leads. 

72 


I should be excited at nailing that 
long-awaited interaction with her. 
Or nervous, at least. 

But all I can think of are my last 
words to Hannah. And the look on her 
face as I said them. 

73 


Chapter Ten 

Kamryn must have read the Oracle, 
because she is at math help today. She 
hangs out for almost half an hour at my 
table. Never mind that it feels awkward 
and we have nothing to talk about. 
That’s to be expected at the start of 
a relationship. Right? 

We do a little math too. So there. 

I walk home like I’m on a cloud. 

74 


After I fix myself a snack, I head 

up to my room to check the blog. I’m 

surprised to already find an entry from 

Heart Huntress. 

Dear Oracle. I went looking for 
that number-logical guy today. The 
helper? I’m not sure if I was looking in 
the right place. The guy I sat with was 
nice enough, but we didn’t really have 
anything in common, and I didn’t exactly 
feel a spark. I think I might have got the 
wrong guy. —HH 

Nothing in common? 

No spark? 

I chew my lip for a couple of minutes. 
How can I make her feel a spark? 

I force myself to read through a few 
other questions before I write her back. 
I need to think through my reply. 

The questions people write in with 
keep getting better and better. A couple 
of people have written in seeking advice 
about their friendships. One guy asked 

75 


me to help him talk his sister out of 
getting a tattoo of her boyfriend’s name 
on her arm. Another asked me where he 

could find cool shirts cheap. I don’t feel 

like a fraud when I’m advising people on 
stuff like where to buy clothes or how 
to handle their parents’ embarrassing 
social habits. 

Only when I’m deliberately misleading 
people in love. 

I pick the questions I’ll answer today. 
I tell one girl that her brother’s friend 
has no right to pressure her to give him 
pictures of herself in a bikini. I tell another 
that since this is the third time she’s 
caught her boyfriend in a big lie, it’s time 
to cut him loose, even though it’ll hurt. 
I explain to one guy that if his current 
flame doesn’t respond to his texts within 
a day, then yeah, she’s losing the love. 

Only after I’m finished these do 
I allow myself to settle into a response 
to Kamryn. 

76 


Dear Huntress. As I see it— 

I like that part, that “as I see it” 
bit. Makes the advice sound sort of 
fortune-telly. 

As I see it, you absolutely had the 
correct person today. 

Wow, it feels so…so…out there to 
write that. 

But there aren’t exactly a lot of 
options. If I’m going to use the Oracle 
to steer Kamryn into my world, I’ve 
got to be crazy and direct. 

I decide I’m okay with it. 

But I need something to get us further 
down this road I’ve started us on. 

I need a ruse. Something to get 
us talking. 

Today Mr. Winehouse mentioned 
we’ll be starting our research projects on 
early civilizations in social studies. 

It’s the perfect setup. 

I see an opportunity to work with this 
young man in a partnership. You will 

77 


be reading, or writing, or creating media. 

It will be about something ancient, but I 

can’t see exactly what. 

I decide to leave her with some very 

specific instructions. 

You will need to approach him. If you 
don’t, he will choose a different partner. 

Then, for the clincher, I add, And 
the course of your life will be forever 
changed. 

And then I click Publish. 

On Monday, everybody’s talking about 
the dance. I had to stay home with 
my mom, who’d just had a wisdom 
tooth pulled and was still loopy from 
the painkillers. 

Kyle sure wasn’t going to miss it. 

So I stayed home. 

It sounded like it was fun. Kyle 
brought home some other girl, not 
Kamryn. They stayed up late watching 

78 


Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and 
then I didn’t see him for the rest of 
the weekend. 

So Kamryn is, without a doubt, not 
on Kyle’s radar. 

A greedy little part of me rubs its 
hands at the thought, She’s mine, all 
mine. The rational side of me shrieks 
with terror—what am I going to do if she 
takes the Oracle seriously and decides 
to come after me? 

I find out soon enough. In third 
period, Mr. Winehouse tells us about our 
research projects. Ancient civilizations. 

“This project requires partner work, 
people,” says Mr. Winehouse now. “Two 
heads are better than one.” 

As soon as the words leave his mouth, 
there’s the familiar rustle as people turn 
in their seats to make eye contact. I keep 
my head down. I focus intently on the 
Dementor I’m doodling in the side of my 
page. I hope Morgan doesn’t ask me to 

79 


work with him. Normally, I’d be happy 
to, but today… 

A hand taps my shoulder, and I jump, 
jabbing a thick line of ink through my 
Dementor’s hood. 

I turn. Kamryn is standing beside 
my desk. She looks kind of mad. 

“What’s that?” Her eyes are on the 
Dementor. It’s pretty good, I think. He’s 
floating in midair, and his cloak is in tatters. 
It wisps out behind him as he slides along. 

“It’s a Dementor,” I say. 

She pulls her brows together a bit. 
“A mental what?” she says. 

“A Dementor,” I say. “From Harry 
Potter?” 

“Oh.” She tosses her head, sounding 
bored. “So listen, do you have a partner?” 

“Not yet,” I say. 

She looks away. “Do you want to do 
the Romans or the Mayans?” 

What if I wanted to do the Mesopotamians? 
Wait. Did she even ask 

80 


me if I wanted to be her partner? 

My mind fumbles for protocol. 

“Whichever,” I say. “I’m easy.” 

“Let’s do the Mayans,” she says, 
sitting in the desk behind me. She pulls 
out her iPad and sets it on the tabletop. 
“Tuesdays and Thursdays are the only 
days I can meet after school, so we need 
to get a lot done during class.” 

I nod. “Okay.” I want to ask her how 
the dance went, but I can’t for the life of 
me figure out how to bring it up. 

I already know enough though. Things 
didn’t work out with her and Kyle. 

She pushes the iPad toward me. 
“Look at the outline,” she says, pointing 
to the black screen. “Wino said it’s on the 
class web page. We want to make sure 
we get everything in there.” 

“Wino?” The second the words are 
out of my mouth, I realize she’s talking 
about Mr. Winehouse. 

She rolls her eyes. 

81 


“Never mind,” I say. “I get it.” I’m 
irritated that I asked. 

I touch the screen and bring up our 
class page. 

Kamryn looks around the room, 
bored, while I locate our assignment. 
On her iPad. While she just sits there. 

She squints at me. “Do you read the 
Oracle?” Her question is sudden. 

My ears grow hot. I am so glad my 
hair covers them. 

“Nope,” I say, without looking up. 
“What’s that?” 

“Nothing,” she says. “Just some 
website.” 

Then she sits forward and looks me 
up and down. She scrunches her eyes up 
a little bit. “Do you always wear skater 
clothes? Or do you ever wear, I don’t 
know, nice stuff?” 

I’m shocked that she put me down 
like that, right to my face. She’s kind 
of fearless. 

82 


I’m kind of embarrassed. 

And now I’m pissed off. 

I speak before I think. Force of habit. 

“Do you ever say nice things?” 
I ask. “Or do you only, I don’t know, 
say mean stuff?” 

Kamryn stares at me for a couple 
of seconds, then sits back in her chair. 
She folds her arms. 

“Just hurry up and find the assignment,” 
she says, jerking her chin toward 
the iPad. “Let’s get this over with.” 

83 


Chapter Eleven 

On Tuesday afternoon, Kamryn and 

I head to my place. Today we’ll finish off 

our research on Mayan religious systems 
and start our Museum Box online. I hope 
this will be less strained than yesterday’s 
in-class session. We talked so little, 
I think we managed to blow through 
nearly all of our research. 

Awkward. 

84 


“This is nice,” Kamryn says as she 
steps into my house. Her eyes move 
around the room approvingly. “Your 
parents have great design sense.” 

“My mom stages homes for realtors,” 
I say. “She can make a rodent hole look 
like the Waldorf Astoria.” 

Kamryn’s eyes drift to the trophy 
on the bookcase. There’s only one on 
display at any time, even though there 
are more than twelve tucked away 
in various closets. Pretty soon we’ll 
need to build a shed to house all of 
Kyle’s achievements. 

“Who’s the basketball star?” 

“That’d be my brother.” 

Her eyes cut to me. “I didn’t know 
you had a brother.” 

I shrug. That would be because 
I intentionally didn’t tell you, I think. 

“How old is he?” 

“Sixteen.” I kick off my shoes and 
head down the hallway toward my 

85 


bedroom. Kamryn follows. The door 

to Kyle’s room is closed. 

“Where does he go to school?” 

“LaMontagne. Senior campus.” For 
whatever reason, our school is split into 
two separate buildings—the middle 
grades and the senior high. It’s a relief 
not to have to share space with Kyle 
all day. I get enough of that every 
evening. 

“What’s his name?” 

I sigh. “Kyle.” 

Here it comes. 

“Kyle…Roberts?” The word comes 
out as a shriek. 

“Same one.” 

Kamryn’s hands fly up to cover her 
mouth. “Oh my god, I had no idea he 
was your brother!” She looks like a kid 
who’s just spotted Santa Claus filling her 
stocking with diamonds and PEZ. 

I shrug. “Well. Owen Roberts. Kyle 
Roberts. You know.” 

86 


“Yeah, but, I…you don’t. I mean, you 
don’t look…like him at all, you know?” 

“Thanks,” I say. 

“No, I mean…” Kamryn flaps her 
hands. She looks around, as though Kyle 
might appear from behind a secret door. 
“Is he home?” 

Why did I bother? What good did 
I think it would do to use the Oracle to 
try to force Kamryn to like me? 

“No.” 

“Oh.” She looks disappointed. 

Thankfully, her questions dry up 
once we enter my room. While she drifts 
around looking at the sketches on my 
wall, I open up my laptop. I pop up a new 
tab and google Mayan religious customs. 

“I didn’t know you were an artist,” 
Kamryn says, moving from one picture 
to the next. “These are really good.” 

“Thanks,” I say. A little flicker 
of hope lights in my belly, and I turn 
my chair to face her. 

87 


“Does Kyle draw?” 

I rotate back to the computer. 

“Nope.” 

“What does he do? Like, hobby-
wise?” 

What was I thinking, anyway? You 
can’t force someone to like you. Even 
I know that. Making Kamryn do this 
project with me seems pathetic now. 

I glance at the clock in the corner of 
the screen. I’d rather be out at the skate 
park, blowing off steam. Like Kamryn 
said yesterday, let’s get this over with. 

“Look, Kamryn,” I say. “I have to 
be somewhere at four. So we should 
get going.” 

She looks disappointed. I guess she 
wanted to talk about Kyle some more. 
“Okay.” She unzips her backpack and 
slides out her iPad. “Have you got 
anything to eat?” 

I’m embarrassed that I haven’t 
offered. Even rude guests deserve to be 

88 


offered refreshments. “Of course,” I say. 
“I’ll go grab something.” 

I push back from my desk and hurry 
to the kitchen. Now that I think about it, 
I’m starving. 

I take bread and cheese out of the 
fridge and turn the oven on to broil. 
I flip on the kitchen sound system. The 
room fills with Calm Radio piano solos. 
My mom’s favorite. 

I change it to skate punk. 

I sigh. Now that Kamryn knows I’m 
Kyle’s brother, chances are she’s going 
to want to hang around with me more to 
be closer to him. 

That should be a good thing, right? 
That we spend more time together? 
Except. 

She’ll be doing it because of him, not 
because of me. 

And Hannah’s right. She’s not very nice. 

Even Kamryn was right. We have 
almost nothing in common. 

89 


Plus, Kamryn has zero sense of humor. 

I swipe a knife out of the block and 
shave off thin slices of cheddar. I pile 
them on two slices of bread. I slide the 
tray into the oven and grab an apple. 
I polish it on my jeans, like I’ve seen 
Hannah do. 

Hannah. 

I’ve lost touch with one of my best 
friends while getting myself tangled up 
in a web of dishonesty with someone 
I’m not sure I want anymore. 

Stupid. 

I wash and slice the apple. 

When I open the oven door a few 
minutes later, the cheese toast is bubbling. 
Perfect. I slide the pan out onto the 
stovetop to cool, and then I grab plates. 

Then I remember. 

I didn’t lock the screen on my 
computer before I left my room. 

Oh crap. 

My stomach plummets. 

90 


I throw the plates on the counter and 
pound down the hallway back to my 
room, my heart slamming. 

I skid to a stop at my doorway. My 
eyes wheel around the room in panic. 
“Kamryn?” 

She’s not here. 

“Kamryn?” I yell. 

No answer. 

Her bag’s gone. 

She left. The music must have been 
too loud for me to hear her leave. 

Crap. 

I bolt toward my computer and 
slide onto the chair. The wheels roll me 
sideways, smashing my knees against 
my bookcase. 

I paw at the trackpad to get rid of 
the screensaver. 

When the screen fills, I’m not looking 
at a website on Mayan religious customs. 
Not at all. 

I’m looking at the Oracle. 

91 


She found it. 

And she wrote about it. In a post. 
And her post is on the home page, which 
means she published it too. 

The title screams at me. The Oracle 
is A LIE! 

I skim the post. 

There it is. Plain as day. Out there 
in the ether for everyone to see. 

Listen up, people! This isn’t the 
Oracle writing to you. This is another 
student at LaMontagne. The Oracle is 
all made up. 

I feel like puking. 

I’ve just discovered that Owen 
Roberts writes the posts. “As I see it,” 
(ha ha), you have been telling your 
secrets to a grade-eight idiot loser… 
and he’s been making up answers to 
try and trick you! 

I bite down on the irony. I wasn’t 
trying to trick anyone except Kamryn. 
For everyone else, I did my absolute best 

92 


to advise them wisely. And now she’s 
calling me out as a cheat. 

But how do I prove otherwise? I can’t 
argue with her. 

There’s no fixing this. 

This is going to be the end of my days 
at school. 

93 


Chapter Twelve 

I don’t want to get out of bed the next 
day. How do I face a world that thinks my 
blog is a sham? That I’m a sham? 

The thing is, it doesn’t feel like a 
sham at all. I was proud of the Oracle. 
I liked helping people. Or what I thought 
was helping people. 

I heave my legs over the side of the 
bed and sit up. I rub my face. 

94 


Today is the first day of the rest of my 
life at LaMontagne. And is it ever going 
to look different from this point forward. 

At school, I keep my head down and my 
feet moving. A lot of people stare at me. 
People in Kamryn’s posse whisper hissy 
comments to each other while glaring 
in my direction. 

I want to talk to Hannah, but I’ve 
bungled that friendship beyond repair. 
She’s not coming back. 

There is a lot of whispering. But no 
one talks to me. 

No one, that is, except Mason. 

He catches up with me on the way 
to Spanish. “Hey, man,” he says. “Don’t 
sweat it. It’ll pass. I love the Oracle. 
Everybody loves the Oracle.” 

“You think?” I ask. 

He nods. “For sure! It’s great reading.” 
He claps me on the shoulder, then drops 

95 


his voice. “But I have to ask you, little 
man. What possessed you to set up 
a relationship blog?” 

I smile at my nickname. Mason is 
four inches shorter than me. 

“You really want to know?” I ask. 

“I really want to know.” 

I look around to make sure we’re 
not overheard. Not like I have anything 
to hide now. “Did you read the posts by 
Heart Huntress?” 

Mason nods again. 

“That was Kamryn Holt. I set up the 
blog as a way to kill her crush on my 
brother. Try to get her to go out with 
me instead.” 

Mason looks thoughtful for a moment. 
That’s rare, so I appreciate it when it 
happens. He glances toward Kamryn and 
Dana, who are spitting evil looks at me. 

He looks back at me. “D’it work?” 

I shake my head. “Not a chance. 
Killed my crush on her though.” 

96 


He grins. “Probably worth it, then.” 
He looks back at Kamryn and lowers 
his voice. “I could’ve told you you’re 
wasting your time, man.” 

He’s not the only one. 

On our way to assembly on Friday, 
Jon and Ryan catch up to us in the 
hallway. 

“Hey, man,” says Jon. 

I look over. “Hey.” 

Jon and I don’t hang out, but I’ve 
known him since grade school. He’s a 
good guy. 

“So, uh, I was Rubber Duckie.” 

I smile. “No way. Really?” Right away 
I want to know how his conversation 
went with the girl on his swim team. 
“How’d it go? Did you manage to get her 
alone, without all of her friends around?” 

He grins. “Yeah. I asked Coach to tell 
her to help me roll up the lane ropes.” 
He laughs. “It was a great idea. We’re 
going to see a movie tonight. So thanks.” 

97 


I shrug. “For what it’s worth.” 

He nods and bumps my shoulder. 
“Good luck.” 

He and Ryan drift ahead, bobbing 
along with the mass of students making 
its way to the gym. 

Good luck? 

Suddenly I’m nervous. The Oracle 
isn’t going to come up in the assembly, 
is it? 

I find a seat at the edge of the center 
row of bleachers. I’m used to the stares 
by now. I’m surprised, however, when 
a few people pat me on the shoulder 
as they make their way up toward the 
higher rows. 

I spot Kamryn sitting in a different 
set of bleachers. She’s surrounded by 
a tight group of whispering girls. Her 
eyes are small and mean. I look away 
before they find me. 

Ms. Parhar waits at the front of 
the gym until everyone has arrived. 

98 


When the shuffling subsides, she moves 

behind the podium and clears her throat. 
Her bracelets make ringing noises as 
she reaches for the mic. 

“LaMontagne, thank you for your 
presence today,” she starts. She runs 
through major announcements, and 
then the grade reps make theirs. Sports 
meet information. Spring fair. Then 
the dance team wraps it up with an 
awesome performance. They’ve put 
some sort of freak hip-hop king inside 
the mascot’s costume today. The team 
does a great job, but Lucky the mascot 
steals the show. Jaws drop to see the 
pudgy panda popping and locking his 
way through Snoop Dogg. By the end 
of the performance, LaMontagne’s 
student body is on its feet, cheering and 
clapping. The cheers turn to wild whoops 
when Lucky takes his head off to reveal 
tiny grade-ten student Lo Ming—a total 
nobody. She’s panting, and her wet hair 

99 


is stuck to her head. I imagine she’s beat 
after five minutes of breaking inside 

fifteen pounds of polyester. 

“Thanks to the dance team for that 
performance,” says Ms. Parhar once the 
excitement has died down and everyone 
has found their seats again. “I’ve never 
seen our hundred-and-eight-year-old 
mascot move in quite such a way.” 
Laughter ripples through the crowd and 
people glance in Lo Ming’s direction. She 
bobs her head once in acknowledgment. 
One of the dance team pats her back. 

She’s not going to be a nobody 
anymore. 

That’s the funny thing. All it takes 
is one notable deed, and everlasting 
notoriety is yours. 

Whether you want it or not. 

“The final item on today’s agenda 
concerns an issue that has been brought 
to my attention by one of LaMontagne’s 
middle-school students,” says Ms. Parhar. 

100 


“It involves enough of the student body 
that the staff felt it was appropriate to 
address at an assembly.” As she speaks, 
the gym falls quiet. The usual foot-

shuffling and whispering slows until it 

stops entirely. 

I feel eyes on me. Dozens. 

Maybe hundreds. 

Is this about me? 

I don’t dare look toward the principal. 
I lock my eyes on the head of the person 
in front of me. I wait for her skull to 
start smoking. 

“A blog has been brought to our 
attention. It appears that this website is 
attempting to mislead others in the area 
of personal relationships.” 

My stomach drops. 

This is about the Oracle. 

101 


Chapter Thirteen 

A rush of whispers breaks out as people 
speculate about who squealed. 

“These are very serious charges,” says 
Ms. Parhar. “The word fraud has been 
suggested.” 

The whispers swell to shocked 
murmurs. 

My head suddenly feels too light. 
There’s a squeezing sensation at the back 

102 


of my brain. Fraud? That’s punishable 
by time in jail. Surely I haven’t done 
anything so bad? 

Hannah’s words come back to me. 
You could get in big trouble if this ever 
gets out, Owen. 

“Without getting overly involved in 
an issue we as a staff know little about,” 
Ms. Parhar continues, “we thought it would 
be best to invite the Oracle’s administrator, 
Owen Roberts, to address these charges 
against him. And then we’ll open the floor 
to other LaMontagne students. Owen?” 
Ms. Parhar scans the audience. 

Somehow my legs stand me up. All 
around me, people are talking. No one is 
bothering to whisper. I’m glad. It’s much 
easier to walk for twenty seconds through 
a hubbub than through pin-drop silence 
when everyone’s eyes are on you. 

I feel like I’m not even inside my body 
as I walk toward the front of the gym. 
I just kind of float there. 

103 


No one knows who ratted. Except 
for me. 

And Hannah can probably guess. 

I search her out among the grade 
eights. Our eyes meet, but then she looks 
away. I shouldn’t be surprised. 

I built this fire. And I’m going to burn 

alone. 

My eyes travel back to Kamryn. She’s 
sitting straight-backed on the bench 
with her arms folded tightly across her 
chest. A sour little smile plays across 
her face. 

And then I’m standing beside 
Ms. Parhar. She steps to the side so I can 
stand behind the microphone. Everyone 
watches me, and it’s quiet again. They 
expect something. 

I swallow. 

I’m glad I made a pit stop in the john 
just before break. 

I lean into the mic and say exactly that, 
because I can’t think of anything else. 

104 


The whole school erupts into 
laughter, and I feel myself relax. A lot 
of people are smiling. I pull my courage 
from them and start. 

“I don’t really have a lot to say,” I say. 

“That’s a first!” someone calls. More 

laughter. 

I smile. “I’ll just tell you the truth. 
This is already as embarrassing as it could 
possibly get anyway. I started the Oracle 
for my own purposes,” I say. “I wanted 
to, uh, I wanted to show someone I liked 
them.” I clear my throat. “And I guess 
I was too shy to tell her in person, so I 
set up a blog to trick her into liking me.” 

Someone sets up a wolf whistle, and 
a few laughs drift toward me. 

“Anyway, that plan backfired,” I say. 
“I embarrassed her and hurt her feelings, 
and I feel really bad about that.” 

A group of grade-six girls sets up 
a little chorus of “awwwwww,” and 
everyone laughs again. 

105 


I look over at Kamryn. I’m sure she’ll 
want to kill me for identifying her, but 
I’m willing to take the risk. She’s already 
called me out. I don’t have anything else 
to lose. 

“I’m sorry,” I say to her. “I really am. 
It was a dumb thing to do.” 

Faces turn in Kamryn’s direction. 
She stares stonily ahead, ignoring them. 
I’m sure this isn’t what she had in mind. 

“And I’m sorry to everyone else,” I say. 
“Because I guess I tricked you too. Into 
thinking that the Oracle was a trustworthy 
site for advice.” I drop my eyes to the floor. 
It’s too hard to look into people’s faces 
when I’m admitting what a mess I’ve made. 

The murmurs start up again. 

“Wait.” A voice rises above all the 
others. “I want to say something.” I look 
up to see Hannah picking her way down 
her row. 

Ms. Parhar leans back toward the 
mic to introduce the next speaker. 

106 


“Hannah Cho, president of our middle-
school student council, would like to 
have a few words.” 

Hannah jumps down from the stairs 

and walks briskly across the gym floor 

to stand beside me. She reaches up and 
pulls the mic off the stand. She’s used to 
talking to a gym full of people. 

“I’ve watched the Oracle grow from 
the start,” Hannah says. “And I know 
for a fact that Owen took every question 
seriously. He worked hard to figure out 
the best answer for each person who 
wrote in.” 

I stare. This was the last thing 
I expected from Hannah. 

“He stayed up late a lot of times so 
he could finish answering questions. He 
used more than one source when he put 
together his answers. He did an amazing 
job.” She takes a deep breath. “And if 
you’re wondering how I know all this… 
it’s because I helped him.” 

107 


Okay, correction. This was the last 
thing I expected from Hannah. 

Gasps and chatter erupt from the 
group. Hannah Cho? Involved in 
a hoax? 

“And this thing about it being fraud 
is ridiculous,” she says, fixing Kamryn 
with a glare. “I mean, yes, Owen put 
himself out there as the Oracle, but he 
also wrote a disclaimer on the About 
page.” She turns to Ms. Parhar. “It says 
very clearly that all of the Oracle’s 
predictions are for entertainment 
purposes only.” She looks back at the 
student body. “And besides, I think 
the Oracle did a lot more to help 
people than it did to hurt them. The 
Oracle—or should I say, Owen—has 
done more than just tell people how to 
be in love. What about Always Angry? 
And Deeply Depressed? What about 
Losing Hope?” 

108 


People are nodding. Some students 
look around, craning their necks to see 
whether anyone might suddenly give 
away their identity as one of those 
writers. But nobody does. 

I think of Losing Hope. I wonder if 
she’s okay. 

“The Oracle took those students’ 
concerns seriously, didn’t he?” Hannah 
continues. 

More murmurs. Nods. 

Hannah looks around. “The Oracle 
did so much more than just give people 
good pickup lines.” 

This gets a few chuckles. 

Jon throws me a thumbs-up, and 
I grin. Rubber Duckie, indeed. 

“It’s run by a guy who has proven 
that he can be trusted. Think about it, 
people. Owen Roberts is in possession 
of some of the biggest secrets among this 
school’s population. But has he betrayed 

109 


your trust on any of them?” Hannah has 
a way of speaking in public that’s very 
much like a politician. 

Several shouts. “No!” 

“Has the Oracle ever led you astray?” 

“NO!” More voices that time. 

“Can you trust the Oracle? I ask 
you, can you place your trust in Owen 
Roberts?” As she speaks, Hannah extends 
her arm in my direction. She’s whipping 
the crowd into a frenzy. 

“YES!” Clapping. A whistle. 

“I just want to add one more thing,” 
Hannah says when the noise dies down. 
“I know for a fact that a number of 
relationships have gotten started because 
of the Oracle’s advice.” 

Someone whistles again. Down 
near the front, a grade-eleven guy 
hoots and grabs the hand of the girl 
sitting next to him. He raises it into 
the air triumphantly. She blushes and 
smiles and tries to pull her hand away. 

110 


“See?” Hannah says. She crosses 
the stage and extends her other arm 
toward me. “Ladies and gentlemen,” 
she says. “I give you…Owen Roberts, 
LaMontagne’s very own Oracle!” 

I laugh and shake my head as the 
applause starts. 

Soon the whole gym is filled with 
the sound of applause. I look to the 
side and see the teachers—dozens 
of teachers—clapping or nodding or 
smiling. 

And then. 

I can hardly believe my eyes. 

In ones and twos, people start to 
stand. They’re still clapping, and they’re 
smiling. They look at me and look 
around at each other and cheer. A deep 
thrumming rises from the bleachers, and 
it takes me a few seconds to realize that 
people are stomping too. 

While the ovation is still going strong— 
except for Kamryn and her friends, 

111 


who are pretty much the only people left 
sitting in the whole gym—Hannah gives 
a brief bow. 

Then she turns and gives me a smile 

that makes my stomach flip right over. 

She puts the microphone back on its 
stand, nods to Ms. Parhar and returns 
to her seat. 

The principal waits for the noise to 
die away. “Thank you, Hannah. Well 
spoken, as always.” She turns to me. 
“When the complaint was initially 
lodged against the Oracle, Owen,” 
she says, “I did take the time to read 
many of the questions and answers on 
the website. And I have to say, I was 
impressed with the quality of advice the 
Oracle was providing.” 

I acknowledge her words with a nod. 

Man, dailyhoroscope.com really 
saved my butt. 

“Given the positive reaction we have 
witnessed today,” Ms. Parhar continues, 

112 


nodding her head toward the bleachers, 
“it seems you have earned the general 
approval of your peers.” She looks 
toward the teachers. “And I, for one, have 
no intention of asking you to stop.” 

More applause. 

I lean on the lectern and speak into 
the mic. “Thanks, Ms. Parhar,” I say. 
“Thank you, too, Hannah. And thanks 
to everyone else.” A few people whistle. 

“One last thing, Owen,” says the 
principal. “Since you’re the only one 
who can predict the future, I’m going to 
ask you the question that’s on everyone’s 
mind right now.” She looks around at the 
crowd, then back at me. “Are you going 
to continue with the Oracle?” 

I close my eyes as though I’m 
meditating. I raise my hands and press 
my palms against my temples for 
dramatic effect. There are a few snickers, 
then the gym grows quiet waiting for 
my response. 

113 


“As I see it,” I begin, and then I open 
my eyes, “I’m gonna start charging a 
hundred bucks a pop!” 

The gym erupts into laughter. 

I look for Hannah. 

She’s smiling.
