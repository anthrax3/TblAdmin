Chapter Five.

Melissa and Zach lead the group out of the school. She sticks to Zach’s arm like a leach, laughing her phony laugh. A bus is waiting for us outside the gate. I climb on and aim for the first empty seat.

“Sorry, this seat’s saved,” the girl sitting by the window says.

“Whatever.” I give the seat a look like I wouldn’t want to go near it anyway.

I continue down the aisle until I see a pair of empty seats. I slump into one and toss my backpack onto the other. Sorry, this seat’s saved, I mouth to the back of the girl’s head. Then I turn and stare out the window.

Thump. Someone bumps the back of my seat.

“Wha’s up, Red?” asks an annoying voice.

I sink lower in my seat, ignoring DJ. God, it’s like being back on the airplane.

“Can I have your attention, people?” Ms. Delucci’s voice rises thinly through the din.

“Excuse me!” she tries again. But no one is listening.

Behind me, DJ is talking about some vending machines he discovered.

“Man, anyone can just walk up and buy a pack of cigarettes or a can of beer!” DJ says. His voice is filled with awe.

I roll my eyes. Whoever thought DJ would learn something on this trip must not know him.

Suddenly a piercing whistle cuts through the noise. The talking stops and all eyes turn forward. I sit up straight and see that Mr. Crawford has pushed up behind Ms. Delucci. Behind him stands Mr. Akimoto, who is either embarrassed or very interested in a dust speck on the floor. I wonder if he’s thinking how poorly behaved we are.

“All right, now that I have your attention,” Mr. Crawford says. He gestures for Ms. Delucci to continue.

“I want you all to remember that you are ambassadors for Canada while you’re here,” she says. “That means you must be on your best behavior.”

She pauses and stares sternly at us. I feel like she is looking right at me. Then I realize the look is meant for DJ.

“Now,” she continues, “Suzuka High School and Mr. Akimoto have generously arranged a tour for us. Mr. Akimoto is giving up his afternoon to act as our guide.”

She sweeps out her arms as if welcoming a performer onto a stage. Mr. Akimoto steps forward holding a cordless microphone.

A sudden blast of music booms through the bus. For a second I think Mr. Akimoto is going to burst into song. I notice several television screens hanging from the ceiling. Every screen, blank a second ago, is now filled with what looks like a Japanese music video. Japanese script scrolls across the bottom of the screens.

“Karaoke!” someone yells.

Mr. Akimoto fiddles with the controls. The music silences and the screens go black.

“I am so sorry,” he apologizes with a bow. He sits down abruptly as the bus lurches into motion.

“As you can see,” he says, “this bus is equipped for karaoke entertainment.” He pronounces it kar-a-Oh-kay. “Perhaps you would like to try it later.”

Several people cheer. Mr. Akimoto smiles tolerantly. Ms. Delucci and Mr. Crawford give us the evil eye.

“But first, I am very pleased to show you the city of Suzuka,” Mr. Akimoto continues.

“Our first stop is the Suzuka Museum of Traditional Crafts, which specializes in katagami. This is the famous Japanese stencil art used to decorate the clothing of samurai,” Mr. Akimoto tells us. There are a few sounds of interest at the word samurai. Mr. Akimoto mistakes this for general keenness. He goes on with enthusiasm.

“There were many katagami shops in this area in the old days. Travelers would stop to buy fabric on their way to the famous shrine of Ise.”

Behind me, DJ and his friend snicker.

As the streets of Suzuka roll past us, Mr. Akimoto continues to talk. He points out the Honda factory and the new North American-style mall called Bell City. Apparently Suzuka means bell and deer. The name has something to do with a lost person and a bell hung from a deer’s neck.

I try to ignore DJ, who is doing an imitation of Mr. Akimoto.

“And there you have the famous Japanese smokestack,” DJ says as we drive by the Honda factory. “And now you see the famous Japanese traffic sign…”.

I want to tell him to shut up. But I have to smother a laugh when he points out “the famous pick-up-after-your-dog sign.” The sign has a cute cartoon dog, which makes the meaning obvious.

Some of the stores we pass have signs with manga-style illustrations—mostly the big-eyed cute variety. I smile to myself. The manga touch is everywhere.

By the time we arrive at the craft museum, I am happy for a break from both DJ and Mr. Akimoto. The museum tour is interesting, but DJ and the others have the attention spans of gnats. While Mr. Akimoto translates the guide’s explanation of stencil-cutting, I realize I am the only one left in the museum. Everyone else is either in the gift shop or back outside.

“How does that stay together?” someone asks.

I turn around, surprised to see Zach. He is bent over a large stencil covered with tiny detailed cuts. The museum guide explains how a thin mesh is added to the back of the stencil to hold it together. The dye goes through the holes in the stencil and through the mesh.

“The whole process,” Mr. Akimoto concludes, “from preparing the stencil paper to cutting the stencil, can take two or three months.”

And that’s just for one stencil. Probably several stencils were used to decorate one piece of fabric. Not the kind of art I’d have patience for.

We join the others in the gift shop. Melissa grabs hold of Zach, throwing me a harsh look. I pretend not to notice.

After the craft museum, the bus takes us to a Buddhist temple and a Shinto shrine. Both are several hundred years old. Everything is interesting, but I’m getting tired of old things. What about all the modern stuff that Japan is famous for? Nintendo, state-of-the-art electronics, Tokyo clothing fashions, anime, manga….

As we climb back on the bus, people complain that the tour is boring. Maybe Mr. Akimoto hears, because the next thing I know, we are driving by a racetrack.

“The famous Suzuka Circuit,” Mr. Akimoto says, pointing out the window. I swear I can feel the bus tip as everyone leans in that direction. But our excitement is short-lived.

“We don’t have time to stop there today,” Mr. Crawford says. He waves away the groans of disappointment.

“Mr. Jung, please take your seat,” he says to DJ, who has stood up in protest.

“What are we doing next, then?” DJ asks, a whine creeping into his voice. “When are we going to eat?”

“Yeah,” a few voices join in. “I’m so hungry.”

Mr. Crawford holds up his hands.

“What part did you not understand about being on your best behavior?” he says, letting his glare fall on each person in the bus. “Now, sit down and be quiet. No one’s going to starve. Our next stop is dinner.”
